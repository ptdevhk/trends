# Resume Screening Config (Phase 1 Prep)

This folder contains resume-screening configuration stubs for Phase 1 preparation.

Files:
- session.json5: session scope + reset policy for per-candidate context.
- agents.json5: multi-agent routing list and bindings.
- skills_words.txt: keyword groups for skill filtering (TrendRadar-style syntax).

Notes:
- These files are not yet wired into runtime; they serve as a spec for Phase 1.
- Keep ASCII only for now; replace placeholder keywords with zh-Hans later.
