# Resume Fixtures

These fixtures are used for resume validation tests in CI.

Files:
- sample-array.json: array-only payload (legacy format)
- sample-metadata.json: object payload with metadata + data

Notes:
- ASCII-only placeholders; replace with zh-Hans examples later if needed.
- Keep fields aligned with apps/api ResumeItem normalization.
