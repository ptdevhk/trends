# Sources Used Template

Use this template in non-trivial technical design/recommendation responses.

Pathing requirements:
- Use repo-relative paths in implementation content outside this section.
- Keep `Local files` below as absolute paths for evidence/audit purposes.

```markdown
## Sources Used

  - /absolute/path/one
  - /absolute/path/two
- Context7:

  - /org/project/version
- Web:

```

If a category is not used, set it to `none`.
