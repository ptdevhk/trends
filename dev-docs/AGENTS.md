# Dev Docs Usage

> Auto-generated from `AGENTS.md`. Run `make sync-agent-policy` to regenerate.
> Do not edit this file directly. Run `make sync-agent-policy`.

## Canonical Agent Governance Policy

## Agent Governance Policy (Canonical)

- Canonical policy file: `AGENTS.md`
- Generated mirror file: `dev-docs/AGENTS.md`
- Do not edit `dev-docs/AGENTS.md` directly.
- After policy edits, run `npx tsx scripts/agent-governance/sync-policy.ts`.

### Source Matrix (strict order)
1. Local repository sources, including `dev-docs/*.txt` and implementation files.
2. Context7 references for library/framework/API behavior and usage details.
3. Official web sources only when freshness-sensitive or time-sensitive facts are required.

### Evidence Contract
- For non-trivial technical design/recommendation responses, include a `Sources Used` section.
- `Sources Used` must include:
  - Repo-relative file paths consulted.
  - Context7 library IDs queried.
  - Web URLs only when freshness-sensitive facts are used.
- Use `none` for any category with no source usage.

### Enforcement
- Sync generated policy mirror with `make sync-agent-policy`.
- Validate policy drift with `make check-agent-policy`.
- Validate governance skill package and installed copy with `make check-agent-skill`.
- `make check` must fail if policy or governance skill checks fail.

## Quick Usage

- Refresh docs: `make fetch-docs` (or `./dev-docs/fetch-docs.sh`).
- Add/update sources: edit `dev-docs/packages.yaml`, then re-run fetch.
- Commit regenerated `dev-docs/*/llms.txt` files so CI stays in sync.

See `dev-docs/README.md` for details and grep helpers.
